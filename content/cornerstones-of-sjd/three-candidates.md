We have three candidates for SJD cornerstones for your consideration. They're the next three steps of this topic.

Please don't receive them as decree. As you read through and consider them, ask yourself:

1. Is this something I've noticed supporting SJD activism (even if in background, or "between the lines")?
2. Does this make sense as a foundational belief upon which other aspects of SJD can be built?
3. Do accepting this as True make the rest of SJD easier to follow?
