[The Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) "states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time."

The "Seconded Law" of social justice dogma (dynamics?) is similar: **the total amount of named oppression can't decrease over time.** Like entropy, it can only increase.

The way this works is one person can name something (e.g., a movie, an idea, a policy, a custom) as oppressive (often as a felt experience), and others are only allowed to second that claim. Someone else can't rebut the claim, or name _away_ oppression, or risk being named oppressive themselves.

If someone says, "**Z** is oppressive," how might you reply?

"Yep! **Z** is totally oppressive because..." ðŸ‘ˆ law-abiding

"Yeah! **Z** is oppressive in all of those ways **and** it's oppressive because..." ðŸ‘ˆ law-abiding

"Actually, no, **Z** isn't oppressive, because..." ðŸ‘ˆ outlawed
