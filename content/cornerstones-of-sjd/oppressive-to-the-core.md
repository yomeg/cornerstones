The third cornerstone that we've heard from people so far focuses on the histories of systems and institutions.

This one says that if an institution was created by oppressors (e.g., people holding dominant group identities), or was once oppressive (or complicit in oppression), it can never be reformed. The only way to move toward equity is to abolish this institution.

For example, here are some ways this cornerstone might frame our thinking:

1. If a system was founded by white people, it's white supremacist to its core.
2. If an institution was once exclusive to men, it's sexist to its core.

And, more importantly, once you recognize this truth of historical oppression, there's only one path forward for that system or institution within SJD:

1. Blow it up.

What systems and institutions might we be talking about? We've seen this cornerstone applied to everything from universities and non-profits, to government branches, to policy platforms, even to big ideas like democracy.
