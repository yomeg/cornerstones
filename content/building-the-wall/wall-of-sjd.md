Every SJD tenet can serve as a brick that we place between the cornerstones in our wall. All of the dynamics of fundamentalism are the mortar that bind the bricks together, and reinforce our wall.

Unlike Trump's literal wall, ours is a wall of **ideological protection**, a border that separates "us" (in this case: good, socially-just people) from "them" (in this case: bad, problematic, oppressive people).

All the benefits of SJD and fundamentalism we've talked about so far are byproduct of constructing this wall. It provides us safety and comfort, because we have clear answers, moral high ground, etc. It also clearly delineates who our friends and allies are from our enemies and dangerous people we should avoid.

If we're anti-borders, or anti-Trump's wall, then, paradoxically, our wall is at least in part an _anti-wall_ wall. This paradox barely scratches the surface.
